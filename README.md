## Golden Age Of Video Games

 ðŸŽ® Video Games: A Booming Industry ðŸ’°

The global gaming market is exploding! It's projected to be worth over $300 billion by 2027 (according to [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market)). With stakes this high, game publishers are in a race to create the next blockbuster hit. But the question remains: are games actually getting better, or have we already seen the golden age of gaming?

Let's dive in! We'll analyze the top 400 best-selling video games from 1977 to 2020. By comparing sales data with critic and user reviews, we'll uncover whether video games are truly improving as the industry grows. ðŸ’¥

Our database holds two key tables (we've used a sample of 400 rows for this project).  You can find the full dataset with over 13,000 games on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata).
